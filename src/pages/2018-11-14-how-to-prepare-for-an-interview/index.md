Cracking an interview does not seem to be easy for all. Being nervous for an interview is fine as far as you do not show it prominently in the interview. This blog in particular would be helpful for fresh college graduates seeking for job be it a campus or off-campus placement. Here are 5 points that needs attention when going for an interview.

**1. Read about the company**

Do a quick research on the company you are applying for.  This will help you in an active participation in the pre-placement talk in case of a campus recruitment. Even if it is not a campus recruitment you can always ask questions, only if you know about the company a bit and want to know more. Reading about the company is also very important as it can help you decide if you want to make a career in that particular sector.

**2. Know the job description**

Know the job profile you are being offered and see if your skill set matches with that. Knowing the job description will help you understand if it is of your interest or is something you want to develop interest in.

**3. Know your resume**

Make sure that your resume is always up to date. Do not copy a resume from a friend. Make it a point that your resume stands out and is unique. Do not write big paragraphs in your resume. Select a clean format and only write things that are apt and true for you. Keep a knowledge about every single point you have put on your resume and do not put anything just to fill up pages. Trust me your interviewer will come to know about it if you are lying on your resume.


**4. Dress Code**

Always go to an interview in a formal attire. Wear clean and ironed clothes with professional shoes. Be confident and comfortable in what you wear. Make sure that your hairstyle is decent and goes with your attire. Your overall appearance should be neat and confident.

**5. Show previous work**

Showing your work actually adds a great advantage. It shows the interviewer that you are actually passionate about something and you will always be considered over other candidates who do not have live projects or work to show. For example, if you are a good writer get some of your best work to the interview or if you are a good coder, show a small application that you built to the interviewer. Always back your data with proof.
